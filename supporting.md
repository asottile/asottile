here's the ways you can support my work, both free and not.

if you want a good summary of some of the software I create / maintain,
[github sponsors] has an up-to-date summary

## for free

follow me on various platforms:

- [github]: where I contribute to open source for free
- [twitch]: where I stream programming content for free
- [youtube]: where I upload educational programming content for free
- [twitter]: where I share mostly programming content

interact with individual content you find useful:

- [github]: star repositories that you use / like / appreciate
- [youtube]: "like" videos that you find useful, comment if you want to see
  other content
- [twitter]: "like" / "retweet" / tweet about things you appreciate

## monetary contributions

I am currently unemployed and would love to be able to build open source
software for a living.  These are the ways you (or your employer) can
contribute.

- [github sponsors]: (any amount, subscription, 100% of contributions)
- [twitch]:
    - subscription (tier 1: $4.99 (50%), tier 2: $9.99 (60%),
      tier 3: $24.99 (70%))
    - bits: (any amount, variable%)
- [streamlabs donation]: (any amount, 100%)

## indirect contributions

- using `pytest`? talk to your employer / manager about supporting open source
  through a [tidelift subscription].  I receive a small amount of funding via
  tidelift for pytest
- using `pre-commit`? consider supporting the project through [open collective]
- purchase a pro plan of [pre-commit.ci]
